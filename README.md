# zChat
:phone: :zimbabwe: *zChat* is a chat app with Firebase Auth and initially done for Mobile Device Programming class from spring 2017.

zChat is a messaging app that allows users to sign in and anonymously join a group. Messages can be typed or sent via Google Voice. Users currently cannot see the names of other users or who sent a message.

Improvements can be made to distinguish messages sent by different users or
to just assign random names to each user so that the logic of a conversation can be easily followed.
