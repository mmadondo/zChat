:phone: :zimbabwe: Mobile Device Programming Final Project Sample App - Chat with Firebase Auth

zChat is a messaging app that allows users to sign in and anonymously join a group. Messages can be typed or sent via Google Voice.
Users currently cannot see the names of other users or who sent a message.

Improvements can be made to distinguish messages sent by different users or
to just assign random names to each user so that the logic of a conversation can be easily followed.
